# Cracking
cracking the algorithms and system design questions. 

The solutions are either in :
  - Java (my preferred programming language in solving all kinds of algorithmic problems)
  - C (the language that can sometimes provide a more simplified and understandable solution)
  - Python (a language that can always make things work, a trade-off between getting problem solved vs performance) 
  
This repo is to implement the algorithmic problems that I solved on paper into actual code.
The problems are from easy to medium. It is a way to keep my mind staying fresh.
