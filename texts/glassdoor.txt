- Design an API for searching for contact information . - Choose a data structure for search function - Implement search function


Solution 1: Prefix Tree: Suitable for searching names, phone numbers since the given information is gonna be accurate and within limited charset. This approach is most space efficient. Different names with same prefix is gonna share the same prefix thus saving memory. O(L) query time, L is the size of the search term. 

Solution 2: Hash Map. Pros: searches keys fast. hash function may be able to handle a wider variety of inputs. But takes more space than prefix tree an may have collision on high scale. O(1) search time. 

Solution 3: binary search on arrays? time consuming. Consider categorizing the terms and create hierarchies to reduce search time. O(log n) query time.

Given a tree of order n which is neither complete or a search tree, write a function to construct a new tree of order m in-place. Memory usage is bound to 2 times the size of the tree. The new tree must be complete, and a node A cannot be a child of another node B in the new tree if A was an ancestor of B in the oldâ€¦
